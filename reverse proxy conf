Project Title: Reverse Proxy Setup Using Nginx
Duration: feb2025 – march 2024
Role: System Administrator
Environment: centos, Nginx, Docker, SSL (Let's Encrypt), Web Applications (Node.js, PHP, Python)
________________________________________
Project Summary:
Configured and deployed Nginx as a reverse proxy to route traffic to multiple backend services securely and efficiently. This setup centralized traffic control, enabled SSL termination, and improved load management for internal applications.
________________________________________
Objectives:
•	Route incoming traffic to internal services using subdomains and paths
•	Secure all HTTP services with HTTPS (SSL termination)
•	Enable centralized access logs and error handling
•	Simplify firewall rules and server exposure
________________________________________
Scope:
•	3+ backend services (e.g., app.example.com, api.example.com, admin.example.com)
•	Nginx running on a public-facing centos  VM
•	Backends running on Docker containers or internal IPs
•	Let's Encrypt SSL with auto-renewal
________________________________________
Key Tasks & Responsibilities:
1. Initial Setup
•	Installed Nginx on centos using dnf
•	Configured firewall to allow ports 80 and 443
•	Secured SSH access and hardened the system
2. Reverse Proxy Configuration
•	Created separate Nginx config files for each domain/service under /etc/nginx/config.d/example.com 
•	Used proxy_pass directives to forward traffic:
