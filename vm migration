Project Title: Virtual Machine Migration from KVM to VMware vSphere
Duration: feb 15/2024 – feb 28/2024
Role: System Administrator 
Environment: KVM (libvirt/QEMU), VMware vSphere 7, ESXi, vCenter, CentOS, Ubuntu, Windows Server
________________________________________
Project Summary:
Successfully migrated 40+ virtual machines from an open-source KVM environment to a VMware vSphere cluster to improve scalability, centralize management, and align with enterprise virtualization standards.
________________________________________
Objectives:
•	Replace decentralized KVM-based virtualization with enterprise-grade VMware infrastructure
•	Minimize downtime and avoid data loss
•	Standardize VM provisioning, backups, and monitoring
•	Integrate with existing VMware-based systems for unified management
________________________________________
Scope:
•	40+ VMs (Linux & Windows) including file servers, web apps, DB servers
•	From KVM (QEMU/libvirt) to VMware ESXi 7.0 cluster
•	Local storage and LVM-backed VMs
•	Migration over secure network (LAN)
________________________________________
Key Tasks & Responsibilities:
1.	Assessment & Planning:
o	Audited KVM infrastructure: VM specs, disk formats, network configs
o	Identified OS compatibility issues and created risk/rollback plans
o	Planned migration windows and performed test conversions
2.	Tool Selection:
o	Chose VMware vCenter Converter, OVF Tool, and manual conversion (qemu-img) based on VM type and state
o	Used qemu-img convert to convert .qcow2 and .raw to .vmdk
3.	Migration Execution:
o	Shut down and exported VMs from KVM environment
o	Converted disk images and created matching hardware profiles in vSphere
o	Imported VMs into VMware using vCenter/ESXi and adjusted VM tools/drivers
o	Verified networking and performance post-migration
4.	Post-Migration Configuration:
o	Installed VMware Tools / open-vm-tools
o	Reassigned static IPs and verified DNS registration
o	Set up VMware snapshots and backup policies (Veeam integration)
5.	Validation & Decommissioning:
o	Conducted system tests (login, app functionality, disk I/O, backups)
o	Documented changes and updated the asset inventory
o	Decommissioned KVM hosts after final backup
________________________________________
Results & Impact:
•	Completed migration with less than 15 minutes of average downtime per VM
•	Reduced administrative overhead by 30% using centralized vCenter management
•	Improved VM performance and monitoring
•	Ensured future scalability and integration with enterprise DR and backup solutions
